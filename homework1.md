from Feigin et al. (2014) Lancet 383:245-255
[![doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-4](https://kbroman.org/BMI881/icons/doi-icon.png)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-4)

1. Make a graph of the mortality values (by age group, year, and country
income group). Focus on the rates and intervals.
The data are available in [`feigin2014_table1_mortality.csv`](assets/feigin2014_table1_mortality.csv).

2. Discuss your design choices. (Why did you choose this particular graph?)

3. How would you make a comprehensive graph that includes all of the
information in the table?

Put any code in an appendix.
