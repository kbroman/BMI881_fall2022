### Readings

Assigned readings appear in the [course schedule](schedule.html).
Students are expected to complete the reading assignments in advance
of discussion.

### Written article summaries

Prior to each Tuesday morning class , write a short summary of the article or articles to
be discussed that week: one paragraph summarizing the article(s), and
a second paragraph describing your reaction (for example, aspects that
you found surprising, interesting, or suspect). The written summary
should be less than a page but more than a couple of sentences.
**Also include two or more discussion questions that might be used to
stimulate discussion of the paper.**

These article summaries should be completed at least a half-hour prior
to the class meeting time. This may be accomplished in a variety of
ways. For example:

- Email a PDF or text file to [the instructor](https://kbroman.org).
- Post documents to a [Box](https://uwmadison.app.box.com), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), or
  [DropBox](https://dropbox.com) folder that you share with the
  instructor.
- Post a text or
  [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  document to a repository at [GitHub](https://github.com) or
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).
- Post to a blog, for example with
  [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [GitHub
  pages](https://pages.github.com/), or
  [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com).

For the blog or repository approaches, they should be accessible to
the instructor but may otherwise be private.

### Homework assignments

There will be two written homework assignments
related to the articles under discussion. These homework assignments
will involve an effort to reproduce the results of an article, the use
of computer simulation to investigate properties of methods discussed
in an article, or application of the discussed methods to related
biomedical data.
