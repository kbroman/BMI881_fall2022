**Due 4 Nov 2021**

This is in relation to the paper on predicting nonmelanoma skin
cancer, [Wang et al.
(2019)](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.2335).

1. If a test has sensitivity = 80% and specificity 80% and the
   prevalence of the disease is 9/100,000, what is the positive
   predictive value (aka "precision") of the test?

2. Suppose sensitivity = specificity. What would they have to be to
   achieve positive predictive value = 50% when prevalence is
   9/100,000?

3. Comment on these results in relation to the precision values
   provided in Table 2 of [Wang et al.
   (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.2335).
